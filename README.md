In this project, I developed an AI-based recommendation system as part of an internship task. The main goal was to create a system that suggests products or content to users based on their preferences. I implemented the solution using Java programming along with the Apache Mahout library, which supports collaborative filtering techniques. For coding and testing, I used IntelliJ IDEA as the development platform. The program reads user-item rating data and generates personalized recommendations using a user-based filtering approach. This kind of recommendation system can be applied in e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and any application that requires personalized suggestions.
